### Talk abstract

Distributable user interface components combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are going to change user interface architecture on the web. However, web component specifications are still in progress and full adoption relies on using polyfills for evolving and still much-debated native features.

Fortunately, AngularJS lets us leverage the UI components paradigm while we wait. With AngularJS directives and services and a little build-time magic, it’s possible implement fully featured UI components without web component polyfills. We’ll talk about how we are designing these UI components and highlight some important AngularJS-specific techniques for building them.
